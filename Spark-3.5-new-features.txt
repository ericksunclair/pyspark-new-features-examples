New Features on PySpark 3.5.0

Spark Connect:
- Scala and Go client support
- Refactoring of the sql module into sql and sql-api to produce a minimum set of dependencies shared
- Pandas API support for the Python Spark Connect Client
- PyTorch-based distributed ML Support for Spark Connect
- Structured Streaming support for Spark Connect in Python and Scala
- Lotâ€™s of compatibility improvements between Spark native and the Spark Connect clients across Python and Scala
- Improved debugability and request handling for client applications (asynchronous processing, retries, long-lived queries)

ML:
- Support Distributed Training of Functions Using Deepspeed
- Base interfaces of sparkML for spark3.5: estimator/ transformer/ model/ evaluator
- New pyspark ML logistic regression estimator implemented on top of distributor
- Add Classifier.getNumClasses back
- Basic saving / loading implementation for ML on spark connect
- Implement pipeline estimator for ML on spark connect
- Implement cross validator estimator
- Implement classification evaluator
- Make PyTorch Distributor compatible with Spark Connect

No new features on this version related to factorization machines, pyspark.ml.feature, scalers.



We used to use version 2.4.0 (https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/ml-guide.html) - 
what changed from that to 3.5.0 (https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/ml-guide.html).
